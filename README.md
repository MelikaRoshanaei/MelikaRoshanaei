## Melika Roshanaei
CE Student | Full Stack Developer

Self-taught developer, refusing to leave at 4 a.m. until my code is cleaner than ever before, fueled by nothing but ambition and coffee!ðŸ˜‰  
I started my journey with frontend development â€” now diving deep into backend technologies while still sharpening my frontend skills along the way.
